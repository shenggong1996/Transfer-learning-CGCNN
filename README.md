Transfer learning for thermal conductivity (based on CGCNN)

Note: this framework is developed for transfer learning from the calcluated thermal conductivities from TEDesignLab[1] to 
experimentally measured thermal conductivities, which can also be used for other scenario where the target dataset in transfer learning
is very small (typically less than 500 data). This framework is based on Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (CGCNN) [2]. Details of this framework can be found in Ref. 3 [3]
